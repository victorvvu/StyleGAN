# StyleGAN2 Dog Net
This dataset was taken from a paper from Khosla, and contains 20,000 images of dogs.

Here I utilize the architecture of StyleGAN2 to create (512x512) images of dogs. 


## 1. Summary 
##### Overview
The pitfall of GANs are that they require massive amounts of compute power to train, meaning they need stacks of GPUs to train. At a very high level, GANs are essentially 2 neural networks, one discriminator and one generator model, that are competing against each other. The discriminator produces fake images and is trying to fool the discriminator model in to believing that the images are real. 

This network improved on the pitfalls of StyleGAN1, where "water drops" can be seen on the images and did not allow users to control features. In addition, StyleGAN2 not only improves training time and performance, but it also produces extremely high quality images.
